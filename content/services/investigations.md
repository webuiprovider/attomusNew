## Acquisition Due Diligence

Gain competitive advantage with quality risk management through comprehensive due diligence services. We provide information to guide the mergers and acquisition process for strategic decision making at all levels of the investment process. Our investigative services assess the potential joint venture/companyâ€™s operations, accounting processes, cyber risks, executive team, and management. We determine any unreported risks that could negatively impact a successful acquisition.

Our acquisition due diligence team conducts in-depth research:

- for initial reviews to determine if you should enter negotiations
- to identify risks and opportunities of markets and clients for mergers or acquisitions
- to build profiles of opponents for hostile take-overs.

We collect and preserve the data to facilitate prosecution and future prevention.
