## Cyber Forensics

ATTOMUS builds cyber resilience to withstand and respond to complex and rapidly evolving cyber threats. If you experience a cyber breach, our experts trace the physical and digital evidence using traditional and electronic investigative techniques. We decipher who did it, when, and how. We collect and preserve the data to facilitate prosecution and future prevention.
