If the Covid-19 pandemic has forced your organisation to adopt remote working for employees, it is very likely that you were required to roll out new IT applications and services to maintain your employee efficiency, business continuity and \[production capacity]. But as companies are implementing the new system to cater to the needs of remote workforces, this transformation may not have been very smooth for some of them due to limited technology capability. It is quite understandable that the speed with which the pandemic has spread, organisations understandably did not put cybersecurity in the forefront while implementing a remote workspace system. 

While organisational IT infrastructures may be overloaded with increased demand, it has given cyber criminals an opportunity to exploit vulnerabilities in temporary and newly implemented IT systems. Now that the initial pandemic panic has considerably died down and people have started to adapt to remote working, it’s time for organisations to evaluate their changed IT infrastructure and its impact on security. The last thing you would want after being already financially strained during this time is to become a target of cybercriminals and face further reputational and financial constraints. 

To ensure the robustness of your company’s security setup and protect your organisation from cyber threats during this critical time, below is a security checklist of recommended considerations and steps to keep in mind while your employees work remotely.
